# Practice Problems: Semantics

1. Which of these tags are semantic, and which are not?

    + Semantic
      - `<header>`
      - `<article>`
      - `<footer>`
      - `<h3>`
      - `<section>`
      - `<aside>`
      - `<b>`
      - `<strong>`

    + Not semantic
      - `<span>`
      - `<div>`

2. Given the following HTML, would `<section>, <aside>, <article>, or <div>` be the most appropriate element for the tag shown as `<sometag>`?

   + `<article>`: the content would make sense if we extracted it from this page and put it elsewhere

3. Given the HTML from question 2, would it be appropriate to replace `<sometag>` with `<address>` or `<blockquote>`? If so, which one?

    + You can use `<blockquote>` since its an extended quote. You can wrap the entire `<blockquote>` in an `<article>` tag. 

4. Given the following HTML, would `<section>, <aside>, <article>, or <div>` be the most appropriate element for the tag shown as `<sometag>`?

    + `<section>` is the best choice. The content is part of a larger body of content on the page. 

5. Given the following HTML, would `<aside>, <section>, <blockquote>, or <div>` be the most appropriate element for the tag shown as `<sometag>?`

    + An `<aside>` tag would make sense here. The content seems like a comment or instructions.
